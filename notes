BUGS:
    On scene change, if the info box is up, it jumps into the game div

    In components.js with the npc component moveTo will sometimes say _settings is not defined when in the EnterFrame event. Currently we are ignoring this and it appears to work fine, but we may want to check this out if we getan unexplainable error.
